# Nade Language Prototype

#### First things first:
- This is not an actual language that works, more so just a proof of concept and like something I want to do
#### Second:
- I'd love if someone got this to work, I doubt it would work *well*, but yk, it would be *cool*?
#### Lastly:
- This is mainly just a bunch of scattered documentation, it won't have all the methods it needs, just base documentation and how to do stuff, like grammar rules

I hope you enjoy this weird ass thing I am doing :)
